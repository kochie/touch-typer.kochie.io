# Privacy Policy

I'll keep it simple, Touch Typer does not collect, use, or sell your data.

It does use some third party services to monitor app health and usage. If you have any concerns or questions you can contact me at [robert@kochie.io](mailto:robert@kochie.io)

## Fathom Analytics

Touch Typer uses [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com) to track metrics including number of active users and their current country. This is used exclusively to monitor app stability and use. You can [read their policy on their website](https://usefathom.com/privacy). To disable Fathom you can find that option in the settings panel.

## Sentry

Touch Typer uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) to monitor app performance and diagnose crashes in real time. This information is used exclusively to diagnose app issues and can't be turned off at the moment. You can [read more about Sentry privacy policy here](https://sentry.io/privacy/).
